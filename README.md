# Hardware Software Platform : Altera Quartus DE1 SoC - ADC (driver and application)
This Github repository is made in the frame of the course of M. Valderamma (FPMS-UMONS, Belgium) in Hardware Software Platform.
The goal of this course is to write a tutorial about a specific component (here it is an ADC), create or use an existing driver, create an application (human interaction interface) and test it on the board.
