# Hardware Software Platform : Altera Quartus DE1 SoC - ADC (driver and application)
This Github repository is made in the frame of the course of M. Valderamma (FPMS-UMONS, Belgium) in Hardware Software Platform.
The goal of this course is to write a tutorial about a specific component (here it is an ADC), create or use an existing driver, create an application (human interaction interface) and test it on the board.

The FPGA board that is used in this project is Altera DE1-SoC rev. D. The ADC model on the board is AD7928. All the information provided in the tutorial comes from personal knowledge, experiment and from the .PDF documentation that can be found in the "documentation" folder.

The video demonstrating how our application works can be found here : https://youtu.be/aX6UkGxf2ac
